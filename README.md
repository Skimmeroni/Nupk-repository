# Repository
A repository of installation scripts. I have written these with [Nupk](https://github.com/Skimmeroni/Nupk) in mind,
but can also work on their own.

They were written with my needs in mind, which may differ from yours.
Of course, you are free to fork the repo and change it as you wish.
